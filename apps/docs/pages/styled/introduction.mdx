# Introduction

In web development, it is preferable to use CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) due to several key advantages.  
CSS enhances performance through optimization for loading and rendering in browsers, facilitates style reuse, offers a simple declarative syntax for defining styles, 
promotes responsiveness for adaptive layouts, and improves accessibility.  
Additionally, CSS simplifies maintenance and scalability, allowing for consistent style changes and design expansion as the website evolves.  

In summary, CSS is essential for creating professional websites, providing an efficient, maintainable, and high-performing solution for managing appearance and enhancing the user experience.
